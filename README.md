# stimuliPresentationProgram

This program simplifies the psychtoolbox by placing a wrapper around this toolbox. The user provides a set of stimuli in the format of csv files (so called operation files) and the program reads those simple commands and show the stimuli on the screen. The program reads the operations from each line of the operation files placed in the “RunOperationsFiles” folder. The onsets and information are saved then in a text file and, for each run, as a Run#.mat file as well.
